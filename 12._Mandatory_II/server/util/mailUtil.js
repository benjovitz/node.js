      Looks like your password is feeling a bit lonely and wandered off somewhere. Silly password, right? No worries, we've got a plan to bring it back from its little escapade.
      
      Ready for the super tricky steps? Here we go:
      
          Clicky-click: Follow this "super secret" link http://localhost:8080/newPassword to start the quest. Yeah, we're making it sound like an epic adventure, but it's just finding a password. Exciting, huh?
            
          Follow the rainbow trail: No, seriously. There's no rainbow. But there's a trail of letters and numbers. Your password might be chilling there. Follow it like it's the most important thing you'll do today.
      
          Tadaaaa! You did it! Your password is back, and life is grand again. Until the next time it decides to play hide-and-seek.
      
      Remember, passwords need love too. Show it some attention, or who knows where it'll go next time?
      
      Best of luck,
      The Condescending Password Patrol ðŸ™„`,
