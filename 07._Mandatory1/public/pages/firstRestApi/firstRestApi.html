<h1>REST</h1>

<h2>Rest conventions</h2>
<div class="text-field">
    There are some REST conventions to follow to make sure the is consitency in different REST api's. <br>
    <h3>Order</h3>
    The order of the endpoints in the specific app is to make it easy for developers to find a specific endpoint because they know where to look for it.
    The order is as follows: <br>
    <h4>get</h4>
    Which is used to get information from the server. The only info the client can send is via parameters.
    <h4>post</h4>
    Which is used to create new instances.
    <h4>patch</h4>
    Which is used to update one or more properties of a single instance.
    <h4>put</h4>
    Which is used to update all of the properties of a single instance.
    <h4>delete</h4>
    Which is used to delete a single instance.
    <h3>Naming</h3>
    Lets say we have a database of octopuses. The endpoint name would reflect what entity we are affecting and it should be plural.
    <h4>get: /octopuses</h4>
    <h4>post: /octopuses</h4>
    <h4>patch: /octopuses/:id</h4>
    <h4>put: /octopuses/:id</h4>
    <h4>delete: /octopuses/:id</h4>

<h2>nodemon</h2>
<div class="text-field">
    Nodemon is a tool that will listen to changes in specific file extensions and restart the server on those changes. 
    What file extensions nodemon should listen to can be set in a nodemon.json file.
</div>
<pre>nodemon.json
<code class="language-json line-numbers">{
    "ext" : "html,js,json"
}
     
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>package.json part 2</h2>
<div class="text-field">
    We can quickly setup a node project by running the command <b>npm init</b> it then asks you to fill out project name, packagename, package version 
    and the other things it will add to the package.json. It will look like the one below with not modifications. <br>
    It adds a bunch of properties, some which are pretty self explanitory. <br>
    <h4>Scripts</h4>
    We can setup up custom scripts to run commands via <b>npm</b>, i have added the start:script script. <br>
    To run it, we will need to write <b>npm run start:script</b>. <br>
    Scripts which a named <b>start, test and build</b> doesnt need run before it. The reason we need run before it, is because we can name them anything. 
    So we could name a script install which conflicts with<b>npm install</b>. <br>
    I have also added <b>type: module</b>. The default is <b>type: commonjs</b>. 
    There is a difference in how to import with the two types. See examples below. <br>
</div>
<pre>package.json
<code class="language-json line-numbers">{
    "name": "node",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "start:script": "node ./app.js"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
}</code>
</pre>

<pre>export.js
    <code class="language-javascript line-numbers">const exportThis = "EXPORT ME!"

    //commonjs export
    module.exports = {
        exportThis
    }
    //module export
    export { exportThis }
</code>
</pre>

<pre>import.js
    <code class="language-javascript line-numbers">//commonjs import
    const importedValue = require("./export.js")

    //module import
    import {exportThis} from "./export.js"
