<h2>Pushing to a new repository</h2>
<div class="text-field">
    You now have a project on your computer but need to push that code to a repository not yet created. <br>
    Create the repository on github or other git sites. <br>
    <b>git init</b> to initialize a .git folder in your project, which holds all the information on where to push, which branch you are on and so on. <br>
    <b>git add -A</b> adding all changes to the staging area like before. <br>
    <b>git commit -m "message"</b> creating a commit. <br>
    <b>git remote add origin https://github.com/username/newProject</b> adding our origin place for pushing and pulling <br>
    <b>git branch -M main</b> renaming default branch to main instead of master. <br>   
    <b>git push -u origin main</b> first push needs to be like this. The <b>-u</b> is for setting up the upstream to origin (which we specified in the line above, like a variable) and main to specify the branch.
