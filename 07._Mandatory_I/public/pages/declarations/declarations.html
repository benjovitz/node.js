    <h2>Declarations</h2>
    <div class="text-field">
        <b>const</b> and <b>let</b> is only available in their given scope, seen in our block scope (line 7-10) <br>
        So when we try to print the not global variable we get an error, since the log statement and notGlobal variable is in different scopes. <br>
        <b>let</b> can be reassigned and const cant (line 2-5) <br>
        <b>var</b> is available in the whole js file or global scope, var can be reassigned. Thats why it is available for our console.log outside the block scope <br>
        <b>totalGlobal</b> is available over the whole project, it can be reassigned (line 15) <br>
        <b>const</b> can still be altered, in line 17 we have an array which is a const, but it can still take in new values in the array.
    </div>
